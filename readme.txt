== Description ==

Easy Content Templates is a plugin for WordPress that lets you define content templates to quickly apply to new or existings posts and pages. By default, templates are private to the author/creator only. Templates can be shared to other users by checking the "Make this Template available for others" checkbox. Other users can't edit your template, they can only use it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create templates? =

In your WordPress admin, usually under the *Comments* section, there will be a *Templates* section (much like *Posts* and *Pages*). Hover over it and click *Add New*.

= How do I insert them into my posts or pages? =

In your write screen look to the upper right and there's a box there. Select a template from the drop-down and click "Load Template".

= Nothing shows up in the drop-down list, what do I do? =

First you need to define your templates, go to the *Templates* section of your WordPress admin and create your templates there.

= Can I define multiple templates? =

Sure you can! ;) Templates are actually Custom Post Types so you can make a lot of templates.

= What does the "Share this Template with others." check box do? =

If you define a template and check that box, it means that you are allowing users to use your template. That is, they will be able to create posts or pages using that template. This does not mean that they will see your template in the administration area or they will be able to edit it.

== Screenshots ==

1. Step 1. Template Definition - You need to add templates first before you can use them.
2. Step 2. Select a Template - When creating (or editing) a post or page, there's an "Easy Content Template" box to the upper right. Click the drop-down box to select the Template you want to load from the list. Click *Load Template*.
2. Step 3. Template Usage - After the Template finishes loading, you can now build upon the template by editing the post or page and filling in values.
